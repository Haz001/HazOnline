<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a game/software/web developer that hates the way big company squeeze every last drop of money out of us.
They rip us off every day and bully us if we don't pay up. It is horrible and I am starting a rebellion against them.</p>
<h3>Who?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Adobe</li>
	<li>EA</li>
	<li>McAffee</li>
	<li>King</li>
	<li>Ubisoft</li>
	<li>SuperCell</li>
	<li>Apple</li>
	<li>ect...</li>
</ul>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Make better products than them and sell it for cheaper and then buy them out and sort them out. Like <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/">Affinity</a> trying to provide a cheaper option than Adobe.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>To pass the time and get a couple coins in my pocket for Uni.</p>
<h3>TO PASS THE TIME?</h3>
I get very board and I thought making a multi billion pound company might be a good pass time.
<h3>What will be the Business modal?</h3>
To make content to make money to make more content to make more money to make more content... (forever until I die)
<!--
I'm a game/software/web developer in college somewhere in the UK fighting back the evil plague of money first.<br/>
<h3>So whats wrong with money first?</h3>
The plague is infecting millions of companys around ther world that make millions of low quality products and content that are made to make as much money as posible. Look at EA and how there premium games are filled with micro transactions and then make a tonne of DLC. Or look at Adobe that now charge monthly for a product with no lifetime payment option so you have to spend out thousands over your career. And I could just go on.
<h3>So whats should come first?</h3>
Quality should come first, don't poke at your customers asking for more money. Give them quality and only one payment per product. You should only pay once for a game/software. This excludes streaming services like SoundCloud and others. But there should never be any monthy fee for some software like adobe does and you shouldn't have to pay multiple times for the full game (DLC is horrible). Lastly there is never a good reason for microtransactions. I hate going through every app in the Google Play Store (as apple sucks) and seeing in app payments.
<h4>What about free to play games?</h4>
They need to remove the mirco transactions and take a skimme away the ads but thats it. I have no more problems, the ads are fine when they arn't obtrusive like when they are on the main menu. But they come a problem when they pop up in the game or when they are full screen ads. Ads I'm fine with when they don't interupt the game. You could even intergrate them into a game if it doesn't distracts you or fits in seemlessly, like have one playing on a TV or on a billboard in the game.-->
